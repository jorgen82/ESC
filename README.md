There are 4 basic files
1) main.py : This is to train/load/test the custom CNN
2) resnet18.py : This is for the pretrained resnet18 model
3) resnet and cnn.py : This is for the combination of resnet18 with a custom cnn
4) SVM.py : This is for a simple svm using mfcc

Also under predict there is a main file called run_prediction.py which will load the model and test file, based on their input paths and return the prediction.

Due to size limit, we only uploaded the custom cnn model.
